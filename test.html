        <span class="title-project">ABOUT ME (1989)</span>
        <p>Twenty-seven years ago I saw the first light of day. In my early days I spent a good deal amount of time being creative; drawing and glueing all over the place. Over the years I developed a questionably healthy interest and curiosity towards computers, with video games in particular. I was always wondering how they were made, and spent more time in level editors than playing the actual games. That curiosity turned me into what I am today, a creative professional yet still eager to learn more tricks of the trade.</p>
        <p>In 2011 I received my bachelor's degree Game Design & Development (with honours) at the HKU University of the Arts Utrecht. That was just the start as I had to keep improving myself as the industry moved forward. A very welcome challenge! After graduating I worked for several years as (level) designer at Dutch game studio Two Tribes. In 2014 I joined Sticky Studios as level designer.</p>
        <p>I've learnt many things along the way, gathered new insights and different perspectives. New engines, new tools, met new people, improved my scripting abilities. In my spare time I sometimes work on personal projects, varying from commercial projects to small hobby projects - either way I'm always learning.</p>

        <p>My name is Jack Rasmussen. I'm a creative professional with more than 7 years of industry experience in <span class="label gamedesign">Game Design</span>, <span class="label leveldesign">Level Design</span>, <span class="label code">Scripting</span> and <span class="label vfx">Visual Effects</span>. What makes me passionate about games is the combination of technology and creativity, and how multiple disciplines come together to create an interactive experience. Whether I'm designing for puzzle games, 2D platformers or 3D environments, I always try to tell a story.</p>
