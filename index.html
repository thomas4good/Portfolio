          <p>As a key member of Other Ocean’s “incubation team,” I collaborate with colleagues to conceptualize, prototype, and develop innovative game ideas. This role requires constant innovation—creating unique mechanics and refreshing genres to craft engaging and memorable gameplay experiences. For each promising concept, I work across disciplines to produce high-level design documents that define core systems, gameplay loops, and flow. So far, I've successfully transitioned three projects from incubation, including one that secured external funding.</p>
          <p><ul>
            <li> Develop high-level design documents to capture gameplay flow and key mechanics
